Assessment questions?

What did you like about this project?
-I get to apply what i learnt so far. It made me understand the concepts better than just listening and copying codes.
-I learnt the value of creating structure first and inputting details after. It would have made styling easier as a group instead of individually.

What did you struggle with in this project?
-Time management. I was stuck at several parts for a long period and should move to other portions instead of staying.
-Structure. My code are very messy and hard to organise after a while.
-Creating empty space. I was unable to create the space I wanted.
-Styling of font is weak, the look of the website is not aesthtically pleasing. I do not do it well. 

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
-Having a longer time to complete.
-Having a code template for common layouts as reference.
